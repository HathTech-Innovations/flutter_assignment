**Note:**
 - *You are required to create design of both the screens in the first image.*
 - *In the second image, create the design of payment page with search functionality. You are expected to use fake data and mock API calls.*

3. Please avoid using literals or copying the widget. Try to store data in variables or use a JSON file that contains the data. If possible use a state management library like Provider (Change Notifier), BLOC etc. to pass around data
4. Keep you code clean, maintain a file structure and add neccessary comments
5. Once done, push the code to the fork of this repository that you created
