*Note: You are required to create design of either one of the screen from the first image. If you wish, create the design for both the screens (we'll definitely take it into consideration)*

3. Please avoid using literals or copying the widget. Try to store data in variables or use a JSON file that contains the data. If possible use a state management library like Provider (Change Notifier), BLOC etc. to pass around data
4. Keep you code clean, maintain a file structure and add neccessary comments
5. Once done, push the code to the fork of this repository that you created

**Good Luck!**
